#This file clarifies on subarrays, subsequences, subsets and powerset


# all these are combinations and not permutations ( arrangements )

eg: 1 2 3

#subarrays 
-> Picking of elements is contiguous and order is maintained
ex: [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3]

#subsequences 
-> Picking of elements need not to be contiguous and order is maintained
-> subarrays are subsets of subsequences
ex: [1, 2], [1,3]
-> (1 << n) = 2^n


#subsets
-> picking of elements need not to be contiguous and order need not to be maintained
ex: [1, 2] (or) [2, 1] ( choose either of em ), [3, 2, 1], [3, 1] order need not to be maintained
-> (1 << n) = 2^n


#powerset
-> combinations of all possible subsets including empty subset and the set itself
-> (1 << n) = 2^n
